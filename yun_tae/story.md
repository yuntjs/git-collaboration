The chubby monkey and the impossible banana.

Once upon a time, there was a monkey that was a cute chubby monkey that loved bananas, but was having issue with one in particular. He wasn't able to peel the banana. The monkey tried everything, but couldn't find a solution.
Couple of days after he found the banana, he asked his elephant friend to help, but he had no thumbs and wasn't able to help after. Sadly walking on the path, he found his other friend dragon and told him about the problem he was having.
The dragon told the monkey a secret to his problem that was passed down by his ancestors. He spoke so softly that the monkey could barely hear it. After listening carefully, the monkey was shocked and went home pondering about what the dragon had told him.
As directed by the dragon, the monkey went on top of the volcano after walking 200 miles from where he lived. There he was shocked when he saw, a cute little racoon.
According to the Dragon, the racoon was 200 years old and helped many creatures in many different ways. The monkey respectfully approached the racoon and asked for help. The racoon, suprisingly, with a welcome voice accepted to help the monkey with his banana that he wasn't able to peel.
The racoon was shocked that such a banana existed, but just as the dragon told she was wise and knew the answer, however with a price through training.
The racoon invited the monkey next to the volcano to her home and they rested before their rigorous training to open the banana. 
Early next morning after a long night's rest, a chicken woke up the monkey for day 1 of training.
As the monkey stepped outside the house, the racoon had her uniform on with a broom.
